# shc-2021-rsdk-splash

Archive of the files for the RSDK V3/V4 splashes from SHC 2021. It's probably gonna get deleted by the time SHC 2021 starts, so I thought to upload them here. I can't think of any reason why you'd really need it after SHC 2021, but preservation is always nice. Finding out where files go shouldn't be too hard, just look at the paths refrenced in the scripts of StageConfig.
